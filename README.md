# 5e-Framework
D&amp;D 5e Framework for MapTool, based on the work of the [RPTools.net forum](https://forums.rptools.net/viewtopic.php?f=85&t=25490).

## Building
Navigate to the `compile` directory, and run the `compile-campaign.sh` file. This will zip the contents of the repository into a CMPGN file.

## Making Changes
Having built your CMPGN file, open it up in MapTools and make your edits there. Once you've saved the file, run the `extract-campaign.sh` file. This should overwrite the repository's framework folder, and replace it with your edited output.
